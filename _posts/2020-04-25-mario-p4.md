[In the previous posts](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/capri/), I discussed the relevance of the P4 standard in the [Pensando Systems](https://pensando.io/) Capri ASIC.

In this podcast, I interview [Mario Baldi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-baldi/), a well known P4 expert, and ask him to explain to you what P4 is. Mario has also his own blog at [https://blog.baldi.info/](https://blog.baldi.info/)

Mario just attended a [virtual P4 Round-Table and he wrote a blog post about it.](https://blog.baldi.info/P4-Expert-Roundtable)
