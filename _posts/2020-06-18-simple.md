This is my fourth post on the [Pensando Systems](https://pensando.io/) architecture, and it is about the simplicity of deployment.

In the following video, I cover the installation of the DSC (Distributed Services Card), its operation as a regular NIC, the installation of the Pensando PSM (Policy and Services Manager), the card adoption from the PSM and the unlocking of all the value-added features.
