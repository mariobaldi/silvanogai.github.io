My first blog post on this new blog site is a tribute to my dear friend Dinesh Dutt.
I regard Dinesh as one of the most excellent experts on networking infrastructure design and practice. He has just started a blog at [https://elegantnetwork.github.io/](https://elegantnetwork.github.io), which I recommend you to follow. His post on the effect of switch port count in Clos topology is an example of his excellent work.

Dinesh just recently completed for O'Reilly a great book titled ["Cloud Native Data Center Networking,"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920217930.do) which covers topics like network disaggregation, network operating systems, network virtualization, and EVPN, etc. that I have never seen covered with this authority.

The only thing that I don't like is the bird on the cover, but Dinesh knows that :-)
