*This is the second post in a series of four, in which I interview [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddutt/), a well-known engineer and author, and ask him to explain the Clos topology as applied to data center networks.*

[In the first post](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/clos-part1/), we covered the basic notion of a two-tier Clos topology, emphasizing that the core of the network is a layer three routed infrastructure and that the layer two domains are restricted to the edge of the network.

In this post, Dinesh describes the basic principles of layer two network virtualization and deep dives on [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which is the most used network virtualization standard. The discussion is on the data plane aspects.

The third post will continue the description of network virtualization, but it will focus on control plane considerations.

The fourth post will describe how to build multi-tier Clos networks to scale the number of ports.

*This short video is an introduction to the topic of network virtualization.*

The following podcast goes in more details about network virtualization, VXLAN, and Clos networks.
