title: Security - the foundation of trust
excerpt: Scott Stevens explains the foundation of trust required for security implementations
description: A video on the foundation of trust in security with Scott Stevens

In today's video, I interview [Scott Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-stevens-172b542/) as he explains a fundamental concept in security: **the foundation of trust**.

Topics like encryption, zero-trust, micro-segmentation, protecting applications in bare-metal, VM, or container environments, require a robust **Root of Trust (RoT)**.

Scott explains how Pensando supports a full RoT in the DSC (Distributed Services Card) by incorporating dedicated hardware like the **PUF (Physically Unclonable Function)** and the **HardGap (PCIe Firewall)** to secure this RoT further.

This RoT is fundamental to guarantee that the DSC runs only certified software and that all the encryption keys are adequately protected and cannot be harvested.

In the case a workload is compromised, this limits lateral exposure since the compromised workload cannot access the security rules stored on the DSC.

I promise I will make more videos like this with more technical details.
