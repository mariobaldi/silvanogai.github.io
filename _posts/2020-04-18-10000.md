I have been asked by some friends to post a description of the Pensando Systems architecture since I am a fellow at Pensando.

Here you go!

Pensando was incorporated in 2017 to provide a Distributed Service Platform for Clouds and Enterprise Data Centers.
This architecture has started shipping in 2020 and includes:
* Network
* Security
* Storage, and
* Telemetry Services

This YouTube video presents a 10,000ft overview of this platform.

If it was interesting, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel by clicking on this icon.

<div class="g-ytsubscribe" data-channelid="UCZ_wzpfcZXi9iZ5DkYNVBsA" data-layout="default" data-count="default"></div>

I promise I will make more videos like this with more technical details.
