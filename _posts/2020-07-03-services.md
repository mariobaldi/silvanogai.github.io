excerpt: Diego Crupnicoff explains alternative services implementation
description: A video on services implementation with Diego Crupnicoff

[In the previous post](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/service-edge/) I discussed with [Mario Baldi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-baldi/) some technical considerations about the placement of Network, Security, and Storage services in the data center.

In today's video I collaborate with [Diego Crupnicoff](https://pensando.io/about/#bio-11) as he explains what in his view is the best way to implement these services in Data Center Networks.
