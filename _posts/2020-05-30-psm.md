[In the previous post](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/10000/) I described the high level architecture of [Pensando Systems.](https://pensando.io/)

In today's video I collaborate with [Vipin Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jain-vipin/), Co-Founder and CTO of Pensando Systems, to explain the PSM (Policy and Services Manager), a cloud native application to manage policies and services.
