[Ivan Pepelnjak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanpepelnjak/) runs [ipSpace.net](https://www.ipspace.net), one of the most well-respected blogs on computer networks. He interviewed me, and we chatted about [Pensando](https://pensando.io), NIC complexity, SmartNIC, domain-specific hardware, policy management, telemetry, and troubleshooting.

Here is the pointer to [Smart NICs with Silvano Gai on Software Gone Wild](https://blog.ipspace.net/2020/05/smartnic-pensando-podcast.html).

In the podcast i mention a couple of times [this post on the P4 website.](https://p4.org/p4/pensando-joins-p4.html)

He invited to the interview:
* [Nick Buraglio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buraglio) - [forwardingplane.net](https://forwardingplane.net/)
* [Chris Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopheryoung3/) - [kontrolissues.net](https://kontrolissues.net/)

I hope you will enjoy it!
