description: The Pensando Distributed Services Card
---
[In my previous post,](https://silvanogai.github.io/posts/pendulum/) I discussed the resurgence of domain-specific hardware, and I made the GPU example.

[In his post](https://p4.org/p4/pensando-joins-p4.html) my friend Mario Baldi describes another example: the Pensando (DSC) Distributed Services Card. The DSC is based on an ASIC designed according to the [P4 standard.](https://p4.org)

The P4 standard is covered in detail in Chapter 11 of my book [Building a Future-Proof Cloud Infrastructure: A Unified Architecture for Network, Security, and Storage Services](http://www.informit.com/store/distributed-services-architectureseffectively-deploying-9780136624097).
